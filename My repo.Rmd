## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)



### Lots of cars


x = 2+5
x
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

These are lots of plots

why isnt this working!!!

blaaahhh

Ok, that worked.
So the steps are:

1. make a repo
2. clone that repo address using the green clone button.
3. in R: make a new project > do version control> put in addy, > put in folder location info
4. click create.
5. Start a new file - write in it, & save
6. Pull from repo first with blue arrow.
7. then hit COMMIT button.
8. Then hit the green push


What about branching?

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
